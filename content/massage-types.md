---
Craniosacral offers subtle reorganization of the cerebrospinal fluid rhythm and flow. This is done through light touch and intention as your body restores its natural rhythm to improve form and function. Cerebrospinal fluid is essential to our body’s regulation as it provides nutrients and acts as a shock absorption system to our brain and spinal cord. Allowing proper movement of this fluid is imperative and can be constructed if any head/neck trauma has occurred.

Myofascial work identifies areas in the body which have restricted movement due to bound fascial fibers. Emphasizing pressure to the connective tissues, this slow and broad technique is effective to improve joint and muscle movement by allowing increased movement between the muscle fibers.

PNF focuses on stretching and elongating muscles to help improve range of motion. Working with passive stretching and small contractions to target muscles, this type of therapy can quickly elongate muscles by breaking the neuromuscular holding pattern.

Trigger point therapy identifies tender points in the musculoskeletal system. These points feel like knots and radiate to other areas of the body in a specific pattern. Applying pressure to these areas can decrease pain and improve range of motion.
