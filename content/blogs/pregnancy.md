# Our goal during pregnancy massage is to help mama feel good, no matter what trimester.

We will provide extra support pillows for you to lay comfortably on your side while we work on your target areas. We’ll incorporate long flowing strokes to help with circulation but also provide you with deeper pressure to help relax those tight muscles.

The reason we will complete your pregnancy massage in side lying instead of having a specialized pillow with the breast and belly cutouts is because we can address your low back pain with firm pressure. In side lying we can mobilize the pelvis and target your lumbar muscles without increasing tension on your low back. 


We want you to feel as comfortable as possible throughout your pregnancy and we will do our best to support you. If you’re uncomfortable in a lying position for an extended period, we can work at your recliner or in your preferred position. While we cannot be there for every moment in your pregnancy, we can educate those around you on safe partner techniques to facilitate continued massage benefits. If you or your partner are interested in learning techniques, please let us know before your appointment.

Many studies have statically found regular massage during pregnancy improves quality of life through decreased back pain, decreased cortisol levels, and improved dopamine levels[1,2]. These are just a few areas in which massage can benefit you and the baby.

If you are considered a high-risk pregnancy, are experiencing a difficult pregnancy, or have had past complications, we will need written consent from your providing care provider before receiving massage. (i.e., placenta previa, premature labor, blood clotting disorders or diabetes).
