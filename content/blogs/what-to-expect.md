Our set up takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and this is booked in addition to your session, this way we can make sure you are getting the maximum time for your massage. To ensure the highest level of relaxation, we ask that pets be kept in another room and your phone is put on silent.

During the massage, you will be able to relax in the privacy and comfort of your own home. You can choose to have the massage in your living room, bedroom, or even outside if weather permits. We ask for a space that is at least a 10x10 open area to ensure even pressure throughout your massage. You can also control the lighting, music, and temperature to create the perfect ambiance for your massage.

Upon request, we can provide cupping in addition to your massage. We bring the equipment from a traditional massage space to you.

An in home massage is the most convenient and luxurious choice. By booking with a travel massage therapist, you are giving yourself more time to relax at home. Don’t wait to indulge in self-care.
